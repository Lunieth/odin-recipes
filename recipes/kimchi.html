            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Napa cabbage</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Daikon radish</li>
                <li>Green onions</li>
                <li>Korean-style red pepper flakes (Gochugaru)</li>
                <li>Fish sauce</li>
                <li>Ginger</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1:</b> Rinse the cabbage thoroughly and then chop it into 1-inch pieces (or, if you prefer smaller pieces, try shredding or cutting the cabbage smaller) and place it in a large bowl. Combine the cabbage and salt in a large bowl and mix. Add enough water to cover the cabbage.</li>
                <li><b>Step 2:</b> Keep the cabbage submerged in the salt water (use a heavy plate or a sealable bag filled with water to keep the cabbage from floating to the top) at room temperature overnight and for up to 24 hours. After 12-24 hours, drain the cabbage, reserving the salty brine.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3:</b> Time to add more veg! Peel the daikon radish and cut it into 2-inch matchsticks. Cut the green onions into 1-inch pieces. Add these to the drained cabbage.</li>
                <li><b>Step 4:</b> Place the garlic, ginger, sugar, fish sauce and red pepper flakes (gochugaru) in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is well combined and forms a chunky paste.</li>
                <li><b>Step 5:</b> Add the chile paste to the bowl and massage with gloved hands (the chiles will leave hot oil on your hands that can sting, so wearing gloves is important!) until well combined.</li>
                <li><b>Step 6:</b> Pack the kimchi into a 2-quart mason jar, pressing it down lightly. Using the reserved brine, fill the jar until the cabbage is completely covered with liquid (you could add a cabbage leaf over the kimchi to weigh it down, if needed). Screw on the lid and place the jar on a tray (to catch any brine) in a cool place like the basement. And then ... let it be for 3 days! After 3 days, give it a taste. Refrigerate it like it is, or allow it to continue to ferment for a few more days if you like. It is done when it tastes good to you!</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How to Store Kimchi</h3>
            <p>Store kimchi in a covered jar in the fridge, making sure the veggies are always covered in the brine. As long as the liquid is covering the kimchi, it will stay good to eat for up to 3 weeks. Plus, it will taste better and better as it sits in the fridge!</p>
