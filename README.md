Starting the Odin Project: Project Recipes
****The Recipe Webpage****
We'll start making the index.html
On this html file, we'll make a list of links
Everything we'll be non-styled

I'm taking this first part of the program, the intro, as a recap of what I already know and a way to refresh it all. 
I could have skipped it, but the whole Git/Git Hub/Terminal formation I got has been incredibly valuable. So, besides refreshing my html/css/javascrip knowledge, I'm hoping to get more familiar with the workflow using those.
